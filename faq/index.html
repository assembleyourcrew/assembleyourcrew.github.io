  <h2><a name="q10"/>What is Crew?</h2>
  <p>
    Crew is an Android application that shares your location with your Crew for a limited period. The location of your Crew Members is then overlaid on your phone screen.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="q15"/>How Does it Work?</h2>
  <p>
    Check out the <a href="{{site.url}}/about">Tutorial</a>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="q20"/>What information does Crew Store about me?</h2>
  <p>
    Only your phone number is stored on Crew's Servers. This is to ensure that you can connect with your contacts. All other personal information like your name and location is shared with your Crew Members for the limited time that a Crew exists.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="q30"/>How do I find my Friends on Crew?</h2>
  <p>
    Crew uses the contacts that are already on your Phone so there is no need to manage them separately. Just add someone to your phone's contacts and if they have Crew installed they will be available.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="q40"/>Is Crew only on Android?</h2>
  <p>
    For now, Yes. If you would like to use crew on any other type of device please <a href="{{site.url}}/contact">Let us Know</a>.
