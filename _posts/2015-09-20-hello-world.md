Crew has just been released into public Beta testing. Please give it a try, share it and let us know your thoughts on it.

It's a side project that was built mainly to see if it was possible and to get the dam idea out of my head.

There are are countless apps that allow you to share moments after they have happen but Crew brings you together to share experiences as the happen. Be with the people that matter when it matters. Be together.
